I performed CFD modelling 3D Transonic Flow Over a Wing.

A shock is formed on the top surface of the wing as the transonic flow accelerated over the wing. This shock also causes flow separation near the trailing edge. Due to the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces, wingtip vortices are formed.
